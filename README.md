# AirBnB Clone Project

## About the Project

The *Airbnb Clone Project* is a full-featured backend system that replicates key booking platform functionalities such as user management, listings, bookings, and payments. Built with Django, it focuses on API development, DevOps, and application scalability.

## Project Goals

1. **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Tech Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles

**Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic. They ensure the server-side functionality works seamlessly and handles all data processing requirements for the AirBnB Clone platform.

**Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations. They are responsible for ensuring data integrity, performance optimization, and maintaining the database architecture to support efficient data retrieval and storage.

**DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services. They manage the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and ensure the application runs smoothly in production environments while maintaining system reliability.

**QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards. They design and execute test cases, identify bugs, and verify that all features work as expected before deployment to production.

## Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Framework** | Django + Django REST Framework | Backend API development and RESTful services |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Primary data storage with ACID compliance |
| **Query Language** | GraphQL | Flexible and efficient data querying |
| **Authentication** | JWT | Secure token-based authentication |
| **Async Processing** | Celery + Redis | Background task handling and caching |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Consistent development and deployment environments |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated testing and deployment pipelines |

## Database Design

The database architecture consists of several key entities that work together to support the AirBnB Clone functionality:

**User Entity**:
- user_id (Primary Key)
- email (Unique)
- password_hash
- first_name
- last_name

**Property Entity**:
- property_id (Primary Key)
- host_id (Foreign Key to User)
- title
- description
- price_per_night
- location

**Booking Entity**:
- booking_id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to User)
- property_id (Foreign Key to Property)
- check_in_date
- check_out_date
- total_amount

**Review Entity**:
- review_id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to User)
- property_id (Foreign Key to Property)
- rating
- comment
- created_at

**Payment Entity**:
- payment_id (Primary Key)
- booking_id (Foreign Key to Booking)
- amount
- payment_method
- payment_status

### Entity Relationships:
- A User can have multiple Properties (One-to-Many relationship)
- A User can make multiple Bookings (One-to-Many relationship)
- A Property can have multiple Bookings (One-to-Many relationship)
- A Booking belongs to one User and one Property (Many-to-One relationships)
- A Review belongs to one User and one Property (Many-to-One relationships)
- A Payment belongs to one Booking (One-to-One relationship)

## Feature Breakdown

**User Management**: This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures secure access to the platform and allows users to maintain their personal information, preferences, and booking history effectively.

**Property Management**: Enables hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings with comprehensive details. This feature includes property information, photos, amenities, pricing, and availability management, providing hosts with complete control over their listings.

**Booking System**: Facilitates the reservation process between guests and hosts through a seamless interface. It manages booking requests, confirmations, check-in/check-out dates, and status updates, ensuring smooth coordination between all parties involved.

**Payment Processing**: Handles secure financial transactions between guests and hosts using integrated payment gateways. This feature processes payments, manages refunds, and maintains detailed transaction records while ensuring compliance with financial security standards.

**Review System**: Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay, building trust within the platform. This feature enables authentic feedback sharing and helps future guests make informed decisions based on previous experiences.

**Search and Filtering**: Enables users to discover properties based on location, dates, price range, and specific amenities. This feature includes advanced filtering options and sorting capabilities to help users find accommodations that match their exact requirements.

## API Security

**Authentication**: Implementation of robust authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the system. This protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information and platform features.

**Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access resources they're permitted to use. This includes different permission levels for guests, hosts, and administrators, maintaining data privacy and system integrity across all user interactions.

**Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, including passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit and at rest. This protects user information from potential security breaches and ensures compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

**Rate Limiting**: Implementation of API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of system resources. This protects against DDoS attacks and ensures consistent performance for all users by controlling the number of requests per user.

**Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other security vulnerabilities. This ensures data integrity and protects the system from malicious attempts to compromise the application.

Security is crucial for protecting user data, especially personal information and payment details, maintaining user trust and platform credibility, ensuring regulatory compliance, and safeguarding the platform's reputation and business continuity in the competitive marketplace.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines are automated workflows that enable developers to frequently integrate and deploy code changes reliably and efficiently.

### Why it matters for this project:

It ensures every code change to the Airbnb Clone is automatically tested and deployed, reducing bugs, speeding up delivery, and maintaining high code quality across teams.

### Tools Used:

* **GitHub Actions** – for automating tests and deployment workflows
* **Docker** – for containerizing the application
* **PostgreSQL** – for automated DB migration and testing
* **Testing Frameworks** – for running unit, integration, and API tests

CI/CD helps streamline development, ensures code reliability, and supports faster, safer releases to production.
